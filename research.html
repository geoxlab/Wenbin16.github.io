                <p><b><i>Magmatic architecture within a rift segment: Articulate axial magma storage at Erta Ale volcano, Ethiopia</i></b> (Xu et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Lett., 2017)</p>
                <p style="padding-left:20px;">
                Understanding the magmatic systems beneath rift volcanoes provides insights into the deeper processes associated with rift architecture and development. At the slow spreading Erta Ale segment (Afar, Ethiopia) transition from continental rifting to seafloor spreading is ongoing on land. A lava lake has been documented since the twentieth century at the summit of the Erta Ale volcano and acts as an indicator of the pressure of its magma reservoir. However, the structure of the plumbing system of the volcano feeding such persistent active lava lake and the mechanisms controlling the architecture of magma storage remain unclear. Here, we combine high-resolution satellite optical imagery and radar interferometry (InSAR) to infer the shape, location and orientation of the conduits feeding the 2017 Erta Ale eruption. We show that the lava lake was rooted in a vertical dike-shaped reservoir that had been inflating prior to the eruption. The magma was subsequently transferred into a shallower feeder dike. We also find a shallow, horizontal magma lens elongated along axis inflating beneath the volcano during the later period of the eruption. Edifice stress modeling suggests the hydraulically connected system of horizontal and vertical thin magmatic bodies able to open and close are arranged spatially according to stresses induced by loading and unloading due to topographic changes. Our combined approach may provide new constraints on the organization of magma plumbing systems beneath volcanoes in continental and marine settings.

				<p><b><i>Dike-Fault Interactions during the 2009 Harrat Lunayyir Dike Intrusion</i></b> (Xu et al., J. Geophys. Res., 2016)</p>
				<p style="padding-left:20px;">
					The northwester Saudi Arabia was regarded as seismically quite region, but between April and June 2009 a swarm of more than 30000 earthquakes with a peak Mw 5.7 shock on May 19, took place in at the Harrat Lunayyir, one of the lava fields in the province. The main swarm period and the late stages of the swarm have been studied using multiple Envisat, ALOS and TerraSAR-X data [Pallister et al., 2010; Baer et al., 2010]. A series of Envisat data in wide swath mode before the main period of deformation are also available, which have not been investigated. They will probably be able to tell us the evolution of dike opening. In this project, I am going to use these data to study the deformation precursory to the 2009 Harrat Lunayyir dike intrusion as well as ground deforamtion during post-diking period.

				<p><b><i>The 2011-12 and 2013 Jebel Zubair Surtseyan Volcanic Eruptions in the southern Red Sea </i></b>(Xu et al., Nat. Comm., 2015)</p>
				<p style="padding-left:20px">
					Two Surtseyan eruptions occurred within Zubair archipelago in 2012-11 and 2013, about 50 km southeast from Jebel at Tair Island. Both eruptions started on the sea floor and resulted in a formation of new islands. We study the 2011-12 and 2013 Jebel Zubair volcanic eruptions with high-resolution radar and optical satellite remote sensing, as no geophysical instruments are installed on the islands and almost no direct observations were made of the activity. The former eruption started on 18 December 2011 in the northern part of the archipelago and lasted for about a month, generating a small 0.25 km2 oval-shaped island. Coastal erosion during the first two years following the end of the eruption has reduced the size of the island to 0.19 km2. The latter event occurred in the central part of Zubair islands and lasted roughly two months (28 September - 20 November, 2013), forming a larger 0.68 km2 island.  We combine TanDEM-X data from ascending and descending orbits to make a high-resolution DEM of the new northern island and use three-pass differential radar interferometry (InSAR) to map the ground deformation associated with the 2011-12 eruption.

				<p><b><i>The 2007-8 Jebel at Tair volcanic eruption in the southern Red Sea</i></b>(Xu and Jonsson, Bull. Volcanol., 2014)</p>
				<p style="padding-left:20px">
					In this project, we studies a volcanic eruption that started on the small Tair island in September 2007 and destroyed a Yemeni military station and caused several casualties. No geophysical instrumentation was on the island and very few direct observations of the activity. Therefore, most of the knowledge about the eruption was derived from satellite images. Using a variety of techniques, we estimated the area and the volume of the erupted products, the evolution of the lava flow during the eruption, the geometry of the feeder dike from co-eruptive InSAR data, and the post-eruption lava flow movements. One of the surprises was that the feeder dike had a north-easterly strike, i.e. perpendicular to the Red Sea rift, which indicates that the stress field within the Tair volcanic edifice is both decoupled from the regional stress field and is temporarily variable.

				<p><b><i>Identifying Active Faults by Improving Earthquake Locations with InSAR Data and Bayesian Estimation: The 2004 Tabuk (Saudi Arabia) Earthquake Sequence</i></b>(Xu et al., Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am. 2015)</p>
				<p style="padding-left:20px">
					A sequence of shallow earthquakes of magnitudes â‰¤ 5.1 took place in 2004 on the eastern flank of the Red Sea rift, near the city of Tabuk in northwestern Saudi Arabia. The earthquakes could not be well located due to the sparse distribution of seismic stations in the region, making it difficult to associate the activity with one of the many mapped faults in the area and thus to improve the assessment of seismic hazard in the region. We used interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from the Envisat and ERS-2 satellites to improve the location and source parameters of the largest event of this sequence, which occurred on 22 June, 2004. The mainshock caused a small, but distinct ~2.7 cm displacement signal in the InSAR data, which reveals where the earthquake took place and shows that previous reports mis-located it by 3-6 km. With Bayesian estimation we modeled the InSAR data using a finite fault model in a homogeneous elastic halfspace and found that the mainshock activated a normal fault, roughly 70 km southeast of the city of Tabuk. The southwest-dipping fault has a strike that is roughly parallel to the Red Sea rift, and we estimate the centroid depth of the earthquake to be ~3.1 km, with the rupture extending to a minimum depth of ~1.3 km. Projection of the fault model uncertainties to the surface indicates that one of three west-dipping normal faults located in the area and oriented parallel to the Red Sea is a likely source for the mainshock. The results demonstrate how InSAR can be used to improve locations of moderately sized earthquakes and thus to identify faults that are currently active.
